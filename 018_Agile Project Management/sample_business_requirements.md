# The God War Chronicles - The Role-playing Game

## Executive Summary

*The God War Chronicles game is a text-based role playing game.  The idea is to have multiple races, abilities, and alliances to choose from.  The user should be able to enter in a character name, select a race, abilities, and allegiances to start.  With each choice, the site should bring up sub-categories for each.  For instance, you start with the ability to choose your characters gender: male, female, or neither.  Based on that selection, the page will change to illuminate the races available to the gender chosen.  Each race will have an overall aspect summary when clicked on, and after which the user must click submit to continue to the sub-races based on the race chosen, also with aspect summaries next to each.  This process will continue through each phase of character creation including history, physical characteristics, and finally name, which will be typed in and submitted as the final step. After character creation, the user will join a party of other players who will interact as the text story carries them through different scenarios and adventures, just like a Dungeon Master would in any tabletop roleplaying game.*

## Business Objectives

*Create a website with a lobby for game play.  Have a description page describing the world, races, and events currently taking place.  Allow for future game updates.  Have a registration page in the top right corner and navigation in the left corner with the God War logo from the book series in the center top of page.  Have a side navigation bar with the ability to jump to particular topics, forums, or groups.  After the user has signed in, a play button should be seen in the top right hand corner beside logout.  All of this should be able to toggle into smaller dropdown menus based on screen size.  The background color should be light but dark enough to not interfere or draw the eye away from the page content itself.  If possible, find a background image of the main characters featured in book series: Zeus, the Black Hunter, etc.  The main page should only be visible immediately upon arriving at sight, but should only be returned to if Home or logo clicked on.  Otherwise, the game play page should list characters and scenarios as well as a side panel with each player within the party with a dropdown for history, allegiance, race, and everything created upon character creation.*

## Background

*This game is to take place during the Second God War series.  Each character is developed by the user to interract in the events that occurred throughout the book series leading up to the conclusion of the Second God War and the beginning of the Time Between and the Race Wars, which will eventually be added into an expasion series.  This project to build this game is to see if the possibility of building a vrmmo or mmo is a future possibility on a grander scale.  The idea is to draw players in and plan for more.*

## Scope

*The development of the webpage with registration, database, character creation capabilities, and the first scenario are the primary goal.  The rest will follow as the project gets underway and patches are added.*

## Functional requirements

*
1) Header with login/register feature.
2) Logo in Center representive of the Book series the idea comes from.
3) Navigation bar on left top of header with Home, Characters, Worlds, History, and Store listed as links to each of the followings main pages.
4) A secondary Nav bar the runs down the left side of screen to guide to forums and topics.
5) The main page should have a brief description at the top of the page describing game and functionality.
6) A play button that should link to the game page should be in the top right corner beside login/register and should only be accessiable if registered.
7) A database should store users and the respective characters and designs.
8) A discussion board should be linked at the bottom of the page in the footer
9) Also in the footer should be a link to the contact page, credit page, support page, FAQ page, and backup links for the header, such as sitemap.
10) For startup, the main page should be the only functional page with Coming Soon listed for all else, until the pages are assembled.
11) Secure login needs to be a priority

## Other requirements

*The game should be accessible from all devices, with the possibility to create an app.*

## Assumptions

*A database needs to be in place for each character and there needs to be a even flow of communication between players, requiring some type of chat dialog within game play.*

## Limitations

*The Game will not be fully functional at first go round.  It should be playable up through the first scenario, but there needs to be work planned out for creation of algorithms or something to create game scenarios*

## Risks

*This project may not be complete within time allotment, and the scenarios may not be possible to be created via an algorithm.*
